- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps:

- 1- Download the dataset, cleaning and exploring it.
- 2- Create a file to share the documents I’ll findings.
- 3- Prepare the questions that I’m interested to answer them using this dataset.
- 4- Use Pandas and NumPy to answer these questions.
- 5- Create a report that shares the findings I found most interesting
